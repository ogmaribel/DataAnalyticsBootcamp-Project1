# DataAnalyticsBootcamp-Project1
Hypothesis of the project:
Air pollution has been a growing problem during the last years around the world, not only for Global Warming implications, but also for its consequences regarding public health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there has been a reported increase in the number of deaths associated to respiratory problems or diseases related to the air pollution.
In several studies, the principal pollutants that have been identified as responsible of the respiratory diseases are carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM10), volatile organic compounds (VOC) and ozone (O3).
The aim of this study was to identify the correlation between the respiratory emergencies and two of these pollutants, O3 and PM10.

Goal:
•	Find the relationship between respiratory diseases and air pollution using high volumes of data gathered from public governmental pages and API’s. 

Conclusion
•	It was found a high relationship between respiratory diseases and the particle per million contaminant (PM10).
